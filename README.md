# "Before and After" Image Creator

Utilizes PIL to automatically render and save before-and-after images.

Raw images go into the "raw" directory. "Before" images are named odd numbers and "after" images are named even numbers. The before and after images go right next to each other. Once the images are in the right places, just run the script and the result images will be in the "processed" directory.

This script was made to efficiently create the before-and-after images for a gallery on a plastic surgery office's website. Be aware the images currently in the "raw" and "processed" directories are likely not-safe-for-work.
